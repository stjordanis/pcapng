My use case is this:\nif I process a pcapng file with TraceWrangler, I want to keep the\ninformation that dumpcap did the capture, but also add that it was\nprocessed afterwards. I could add a CR/LF to the existing option and\nadd my text, but it's cleaner to have separate entries in my opinion.\n\nOrder matters, and I'd go for append (meaning, latest entries are read\nlast when reading options sequentially), because then you can follow\nthe processing chain if you want.\n",

For the currently defined record types, no it's not legal, but for unknown types it should be legal. Again, need to be specific in the doc.\n- What if the same IP address is used in multiple entries - does it mean the second one updates/replaces the first, or does it just mean the same IP has multiple names?

Since this block can appear several times in a pcapng file, a single file can contain both endianness variants.\u201d`\r\n\r\n- I would prefer if the spec would only allow for one SHB per pcapng file. I'm guessing the reason for allowing multiple SHB's is to facilitate merging of pcapng files, but such freedom comes with a too high cost. One problem that comes with allowing multiple SHB's is that the trailing \"Block Total Length\" at the end of each block can't be used to move backwards in a pcapng file, since a change of endian by an SHB will cause the length field to be interpreted incorrectly. Even skipping forward in a pcapng file can be dangerous unless care is taken to read the endian of each newly encountered SHB. Merging pcapng files is an easy task, even if we allow only one SHB per file, so there is no need to simplify this task even more. There are just too many downsides to having multiple SHB's in a pcapng file. Which reminds me of this quote by Einstein: \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d\r\n- There is no real point in allowing for both big-endian and little-endian. Requiring all pcapng writers to use one endianness will not even affect performance notably. Just think of all the network protocols specified for big endian even though many CPU's are little endian. TCP is, for example, forced to transmit sequence numbers and window size values in big endian, yet you will never see the endianness conversion being a performance issue in TCP. I would personally prefer to have all pcapng files to be big endian ONLY.\r\n- Section Length field isn't used, it can be removed from the spec.\r\n- Having the \u201cByte-Order Magic\u201d field after the \u201cBlock Total Length\u201d isn't great, since we need to know the endian (from the magic field) before we can parse the length field anyway. I understand that this is an attempt of having the SHB to extend the generic \u201cGeneral Block Structure\u201d. However, the SHB can NEVER be parsed as a generic block anyway since it allows for a change of endianness which must be dealt with by all parsers.\r\n- Please refrain from padding stuff to 32 bit boundaries. Doing so actually introduces unnecessary complexity rather than solving a problem.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation: Only allow one SHB per pcapng file.",

GPS Location (lat/lng/alt) as 3x 32-bit floats for EPB and IDB\r\n2. RSSI in dBm as 1x 32-bit float for EPB\r\n3. Frequency in Hz as 1x 32-bit float for EPB and IDB\r\n4. Channel as 1x 16-bit uint for EPB\r\n5. Channel Spacing as 1x 32-bit float for IDB\r\n\r\nSupporting GPS Location and frequency in the IDB or EPB allows for specification of multiple static capture points or moving captures at different frequencies.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nRyan",

In order:\r\n\r\nWRT channel number in EPB or IDB, yep that would make sense.\r\n\r\nWRT RSSI, I'm not aware of hardware that actually receives the same packet on N antennae rather than just picking the best one at a given point in the preamble, but, support for multiple RSSI options per packet would work? (And if they're actually parallel, that may be better modelled as N interfaces).\r\n\r\nWRT. channel number interpretation, this is I guess backwards from the current way.\r\nRather than a protocol specific header (ie. radiotap) that encodes the channel and how to interpret it, pcap-ng can encode the raw channel, then the decoder can handle interpretation if it's required (along with everything else in the pcap payload).\r\n\r\nThat does raise the question of support for further metadata (like channel b/w, spacing), as it stands I have been putting that kind of data in the file and interface comments since it's not /required/ for parsing / understanding the packet capture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

[Kenneth D. Renard's original proposal](https://www.winpcap.org/pipermail/pcap-ng-format/2015-March/000164.html) had  a Location Information Block (LIB), which provides location information.  I later proposed a [Location Provider Information Block](https://www.winpcap.org/pipermail/pcap-ng-format/2015-March/000169.html) (LPIB) which gives a description of a provider of location information.\r\n\r\nA capture would have one LPIB per source of location information, no matter how many interfaces or packets there are, or how fast the capturing machine moves.\r\n\r\nThe location update rate would control the number of LIBs, *not* the number of LPIBs.\r\n\r\nSo there are at least two questions:\r\n\r\n1. *If* we provide a description of the source of location information, should we do so by putting the description in an LPIB or in an IDB?\r\n\r\n1. Should location information be attached to an EPB or an LIB?\r\n\r\nI was mainly discussing the LPIB vs. IDB issue; you appear to be discussing the EPB vs. LIB issue.\r\n\r\nFor LPIB vs. IDB, as per my comments, I see having a separate LPIB as conceptually cleaner, even if it requires that the reader keep track of lists of location providers as well as lists of interfaces.\r\n\r\nFor location information in EPBs vs. location information in LIBs, *that's* where the packet rate and location update rate matter.  In the thread about Renard's proposal, I proposed per-EPB location information in [this message](https://www.winpcap.org/pipermail/pcap-ng-format/2015-March/000166.html):\r\n\r\n> If somebody's capturing while in motion, and we're not interested in position or orientation information when packets aren't arriving, we could have those options available for both LIBs and packet blocks, and say that the position/orientation information for a packet is unchanged from whatever the last values were for that interface if the options aren't present.  That might allow less stuff to be written if we're only interested in the position and orientation at the time packets are captured.\r\n\r\nand Renard responds in [this message](https://www.winpcap.org/pipermail/pcap-ng-format/2015-March/000168.html):\r\n\r\n> Agreed.  Frequency of location information is defined by the application/user.\r\n> Example use cases might be:\r\n> \r\n>   1.  Set location description each time I wake up my laptop\r\n>   2.  Synchronous stream from GPS:  Once per second, per interface.\r\n>   3.  Every N seconds or change in position more than M meters.\r\n> \r\n> Location information per-packet seems extreme, but certainly valid.\r\n\r\nI see the LIB as useful only if either 1) the machine is moving slowly enough, and capturing enough traffic, that you'd get less redundant location information (that's the packet rate >> location update case you mention) or 2) the user wants to know how the machine is moving even if it doesn't happen to be capturing any packets (that's *a* packet rate << location update rate case, but it's not necessarily *all* packet rate << location update rate cases - if the user doesn't care where the machine is when it's not seeing traffic, the extra LIBs aren't useful).  If the two rates are comparable, the LIB doesn't provide any compression.",

On working through them I think there's a simpler approach, presented first so it's more obvious it's here.\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\n- Propose the addition of a Capture Information Block (CIB)\r\n  - Attached to an Interface Description Block (IDB)\r\n  - Apply to all following packets until superseded\r\n  - Only contain location information (at the moment)\r\n  - Option for addition of RF or other information that applies to a sequential group of packets for a given interface\r\n- Separately propose the addition of RF options to EPBs\r\n  - RSSI, Channel (though this is complex as discussed above), etc.\r\n  - There are some cases this isn't optimal, but it supports all options (see discussion below)\r\n\r\nI can update the PR to reflect these changes if you like to see them, or wait until they've been further discussed.\r\n\r\n### Comments / Replies\r\n> So what does \"capture information\" refer to? It's presumably not information about a particular packet, because that should be done as options for packet blocks of various sorts (Enhanced Packet Blocks or any future packet block types).\r\n\r\nIt could be called \"Capture Metadata Block (CMB)\" or anything similar, I am open to alternate names if there is a more appropriate one. My original proposal was just to add options to the Enhanced Packet Block (EPB) or Interface Descriptor Block (IDB), however, I think it makes sense to use a separate block:\r\n- for compression as you mention\r\n- to allow the metadata to be reused against EPBs / IDBs (/ any future packet blocks)\r\n- so we have a mechanism to update metadata through time\r\n\r\n> Do you foresee other forms of information where this putting the information in a CIB, rather than in per-packet options, would result in compression rather than expansion?\r\n\r\nDefinitely more location-related ones, I'm not sure about other types of information. Some RF measurements (like RSSI) are definitely better per packet, some like channel bandwidth are per-interface and/or change with time, but this name supports it if we come up with other options.\r\n\r\n> What sort of time stamps? A time stamp of the time at which the information was determined?\r\n\r\nYeah, if we're using global lat/lng/alt from a GPS it'll probably be nice to have the GPS time along with it.\r\n\r\n> Does the answer depend on which particular RF information is being discussed?\r\n\r\nYep. Bandwidth / Frequency / Channel spacing are often per-interface for simple networks, but are not for wifi etc (as @kismetwireless [pointed out](https://github.com/pcapng/pcapng/issues/48#issuecomment-346529632)).\r\nIf you have a channel hopping interface and it receives > 1 packet per channel hop it might be useful to define the channel there. Except, you can also have wide-band interfaces listening on multiple channels at once, which is really only served by per-packet information.\r\nAlso, it makes no sense having something like RSSI in a reusable block because it only exists per packet.\r\n\r\n> If the intent is to provide compression of per-packet information that changes sufficiently infrequently, attaching them to EPBs would cover that use case. Attaching them to an IDB would presumably be useful for the case where the information never changes.\r\n\r\nI was thinking to link the information blocks to the interface blocks (rather than vice versa), so you can re-issue updates to an interface, and the latest CIB applies to all packets on that interface until the next one is read.\r\n\r\nThis also works kinda nicely from the writing side, if you're capturing packets you just have to interleave CIBs when you receive updated location information and they'll apply to everything until your next CIB, which also works nicely for the static case.\r\n\r\nIt does mean if you have multiple interfaces in the same place, you need multiple CIBs. We could allow them to be attached to N interfaces if that was desired, though it seems a little more complicated.\r\n\r\n> position, orientation, and velocity of the device (the latter presumably being the zero vector, so maybe it needn't even be reported).\r\n\r\nThe CIB is really just a list of options, so whatever is relevant can be reported and whatever is not can be elided.\r\n\r\n> BTW, if an EPB has a CIB attached to it and is attached to an IPB with a CIB attached to it, if a given option is present in both CIBs, should the option value in the CIB attached to the EPB be the one used?\r\n\r\nThe EPB attached block would override and of the same options specified in the IDB attached block, so the EPB version lets us override the IDB version.\r\n\r\nOn thinking more I'm not completely sure we need to be able to attach them to EPB at all, it might be better to rip out the strictly per-packet options like RSSI and channels as EPB options and remove the ability to link this with an EPB, which would vastly simplify the complexity of parsing logic.\r\n\r\n>  it might be possible for a mobile device capturing packets to switch from one provider to another if the device moves out of the area covered by the nav system it's currently using\r\n\r\nIn my experience, most multi-constellation systems still output lat/lng/alt, I don't think which system is providing the information is necessarily relevant. We could add an enum to support that identification, but, I don't know how much sense that makes when you're using a variety of networks.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced this is a problem that should be solved within pcap.\r\n\r\n> Given its absence from the proposal, presumably angular velocity (d{orientation}/dt) isn't of interest?\r\n\r\nI'm not interested in it, but, once we have decided how we're going to do this / split up interface or packet related options, introducing new options is reasonably trivial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Add a bunch of options to EPBs (and presumably other packet types in future)\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be the simplest option, though does require all metadata to be repeated every packet.\r\n\r\nAn example file would be:\r\n1. [IDB-1] defines interface 1\r\n3. [EPB-1] packet capture, contains metadata\r\n3. [EPB-2] packet capture, contains metadata\r\n\r\nIt's very easy, though not super efficient and does not support location sampling >> packet receipt rate.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Add a metadata block that EPBs can refer to\r\n\r\nCreate a metadata block and associated options that are linked to a given packet using an option in the EPB.\r\n\r\nThis would look something like:\r\n1. [IDB-1] defines interface 1\r\n2. [MDB-1] contains metadata\r\n3. [EPB-1] packet capture, linked to MDB-1\r\n3. [EPB-2] packet capture, linked to MDB-1\r\n4. [MDB-2] contains metadata\r\n3. [EPB-3] packet capture, linked to MDB-2\r\n\r\nThis requires some ordering rules (metadata defined before packet so the data is available when streaming), and tracking of metadata block IDs. The static case requires only one metadata block (per interface), however, packet block sizes will increase slightly with metadata link information.\r\n\r\nI don't think you can link the other way without introducing unique EPB IDs or an EPB ID counter, which generalises poorly for other packet types.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Add a metadata block that is associated with an IDB as well as options to EPBs where appropriate\r\n\r\nFor persistent metadata (eg. location), create a metadata block that is always applied to an interface and applies to any packets following it. For packet-related metadata (eg. RSSI), add options to EPBs.\r\nThis is what I proposed [here](https://github.com/pcapng/pcapng/issues/48#issuecomment-397863816), but, I may not have been clear enough about it.\r\n\r\nAn example file might look like:\r\n1. [IDB-1] defines interface 1\r\n2. [MDB-1] attached to IDB-1, sets location of interface 1\r\n3. [EPB-1] packet capture inherits metadata from MDB-1\r\n3. [EPB-2] packet capture inherits metadata from MDB-1\r\n4. [MDB-2] attached to IDB-1, updates location of interface 1\r\n4. [MDB-3] attached to IDB-1, updates location of interface 1\r\n3. [EPB-3] packet capture inherits metadata from MDB-3\r\n\r\nThis allows compression for the static use case (eg. where location doesn't change) and where packet rate >> change in metadata rate.  Where this is not true, up to one metadata block may be required per packet block. Persistent metadata is also generalized over all packet types, and interface location can be tracked at a higher rate than packet capture if required.\r\n\r\n### What now\r\nMy preference is for option three as I think it's reasonably simple/efficient/covers all use cases, or option one for simplicity, and I would be happy to go ahead and rework the PR to match either.\r\nAm I missing anything / are there any other approaches we should still be considering?\r\n\r\n",

In the following table, the bits are numbered with 0 being the most-significant bit and 31 being the least-significant bit of the 32-bit unsigned integer.\r\n\r\nwith bits 0 and 1 being the packet direction.\r\n\r\nThat appears to indicate that the direction field is at the *top* of the flags word, so that, for example an inbound packet, with the FCS length field zero, the reception type unknown, and no link-layer-dependent error, would have a flags word of 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000, or 0x40000000.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n- macOS treats the low-order bit as bit 0 in libpcap and tcpdump, so that such a packet would have a flags word of 0x00000001;\r\n- Wireshark's text2pcap program, which converts various text dumps to pcap or pcapng, can parse a \"packet preamble\" in which \"i\" or \"I\" stands for \"incoming\" and \"o\" or \"O\" stands for \"outgoing, and it treats the low-order bit as bit 0, so such a packet would have a flags word of 0x00000001;\r\n- Wireshark's pcapng-reading code assumes the FCS is in bits 8-5, with bit 0 being the low-order bit;\r\n\r\nso there are, depending on whether you consider the two pieces of Wireshark code as one implementation or two (they were done by different people, but maybe the person who made the text2pcap changes was influenced by my screwup in the pcapng reading code), two or three implementations of pcapng that treat bit 0 as the low-order bit.\r\n\r\nThere may be, or have been, *another* implementation that did so; the capture attached to [Wireshark bug 11665](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11665) has ISDN LAPD packets in it, and the direction field at the bottom of the flags field has a value of 1 for network->user packets and 2 for user->network packets, which would make sense if the machine on which the capture was being done was \"terminal equipment\" (or whatever the right ISDN term is), i.e. if it's the \"user\".\r\n\r\nI don't know whether there are any implementations that treat bit 0 as the high-order bit.  None of the pcapng files I have on hand appear to do so - they all seem to have that information in the low-order bits.\r\n\r\nSo, whilst I *really* hate to do this, would the least bad solution be to change the spec to say that bit 0 is the *low*-order bit?\r\n\r\nIf there truly are *no* implementations that treated it as the high-order bit, that would work, with the risk that somebody develops a 0-is-the-high-order-bit implementation based on the current or earlier state of the specification.\r\n\r\nIf there are only *private, internal* implementations that do so, that would cause pain to some unknown number of implementors, but they wouldn't have to worry about the general user base of programs that handle (or that will handle in the future) the flags field.\r\n\r\nIf there are *public* implementations that do so, we may be stuck with heuristics, as there are also public implementations that treat bit 0 as the low-order bit; as long as nobody used the \"link-layer-dependent flags\" part of the flags field, we could treat any flags word with the upper 16 bits non-zero as coming from a \"bit 0 as the high-order bit\" implementation and any flags word with the lower 16 bits non-zero as coming from a \"bit 0 as the low-order bit\" implementation.  If both are zero, it obviously doesn't matter; if both are non-zero, that'll need more heuristics, and they'd be more likely to fail.",

Thus, if you miss the explicit \"bit 0 is the high-order bit\" note, you might think of bit 0 as being the low-order bit.\r\n\r\n- The C bit-shifting operators fit a bit more cleanly with the low-order bit being 0 - if you want to extract a field in bits *M* through *N* (*M* <= *N*) using shifts and masks, if the low-order bit is 0, you shift right *M* bits and then mask, but if the high-order bit is 0, you shift a *K*-bit word right *K* - *M* - 1 bits.  This might also contribute to assuming that bit 0 is the low-order bit.\r\n\r\n- The implementations that got the bit numbering backwards may have been done independently. The first such implementation that I know of was the one I put into pcapng to extract the FCS length field; that was the only field it extracted, so, unless you were looking at the \"fetch the FCS length\" code *and* extrapolated from there to \"the reception type is below that, and the direction is below *that*\", you probably didn't get \"the direction is in the lower 2 bits\" from there.\r\n\r\nSo this *somewhat* suggests that it's not inconceivable that still others may have made the same error.",

Pros: easier to parse as consumer in a single pass, sometimes it is not possible to guarantee that secrets are timely available. Cons: requires producers to rewrite a pcapng after a capture is complete.\r\n- [x] padding/alignment? Use options for this or...? *Added new Secrets Length field*\r\n- [ ] ~~Add other users?

[About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) says:\r\n\r\n> Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the \"Files changed\" tab.\r\n\r\nSo, as far as I know, \"make another commit to fix the typo and do `git push`\" should work, and \"make a `git commit -a --amend` to fix the typo and do `git push`\" might also work.\r\n\r\nI've only rarely done git pulls (the main git repositories on which I work are libpcap, tcpdump, and the pcapng spec, and I'm a core committer to all of them, so I just directly `git push` from my machine), so I don't know if the second of those would work (the equivalent - `git commit -a --amend` followed by `git review` - works on the Wireshark repository).",

When a packet hits interface A on ingress, an ECB entry gets created, TTL gets decremented, and right before it egresses on interface B another ECB entry gets created in the trace file. In this case, two packets are in the capture file, which are not identical but the epb_packetid can be used to correlate them.",

Or am I wrong?\r\n\r\nHi, Specification Required actually implies Designated Experts (aka \"expert review\").\r\nSo, we have on the tcpdump-workers, essentially run things as expert review, and asked/begged for a Specification, but\r\nwe haven't insisted upon it.  So I'm trying to keep a similar policy.  Guy has mostly been that expert, with Dennis and I asking questions around the edges.  \r\nOften in github issues where someone does a pull request.  I think that we can probably adapt the IANA process into github Issues as in almost all cases we'll want to put it into libpcap as well.   \r\n\r\nIf we were to *DROP* Specification Required, then we could go via ISE.\r\nBut, I've had a bunch of back and forth with Adrian Farrel (the ISE), and he would like to see us exhaust all other avenues first.\r\nSo I would tentatively say we go until Jan.31 or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
